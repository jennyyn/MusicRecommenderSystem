The girl walked into the haunted house
----
With a heart pounding like a cautious drum, the girl stepped through the creaking threshold of the haunted house, the air thick with a sinister whisper of forgotten tales. Shadows danced around her, flitting like playful specters, as she ventured deeper into the eerie embrace of the unknown. Each creak of the aged floorboards beneath her feet sent a shiver up her spine, a thrilling invitation from the phantoms of the past, urging her to explore their haunted domain.
